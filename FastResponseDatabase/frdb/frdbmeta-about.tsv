field	Description
domain	name of the table in FRDB
field	name of the column in FRDB table
field name in merged curated file	corresponding name of the column in human-readable curated file
field type	type of the field: PK - primary key; FK - foreign key; main - field containing data; technical - field containing technical or derived information
data type	data type: boolean; integer; string; double; dictionary - value is controlled by the dictionary. Dictionaries are provided in the ""dictionary"" sheet
dictionary	name of the dictionary for the data of ""dictionary"" type
format	data specifications for some of the ""string"" type values
description	description of the field
value	possible value of the term according to the dictionary
target	DDI target name (preferred value)
target_class	DDI target class (protein, group, isoform, variant)
related_targets	Related targets (parent targets for isoforms and variants; componets for groups)
UNIPROT	UNIPROT id of the DDI target
ChEMBL	ChEMBL id of the DDI target
target_name	Full name of the taget
target_synonym	Synonyms for the target
target_organism	Organism for DDI target
target_human_ortholog	Human ortholog for DDI target
quantity	Quantity measured by a unit
unit	Unit of measurement
description	Description of the unit of measurement
standard_unit_1	Level 1 standard unit
standard_unit_1_factor	Conversion factor from unit to standard_unit_1. To obtain value in standard_unit_1, value X in units must be multiplied by a standard_unit_1_factor
standard_unit_2	Level 1 standard unit
standard_unit_2_factor	Conversion factor from standard_unit_1 to standard_unit_2. To obtain value in standard_unit_2, value X in units must be multiplied by a standard_unit_1_factor times standard_unit_2_factor. The meaning of individual factors are provided in the units_factors table. The values in square brackets means inverse values: for example, conversion factor ""[AMw]*1000000"" means value should be multiplied by 1000000 and then divided by the molecular mass of the analyte expressed in g/mol
standard_unit_2_conversion_type	Type of the conversion factors involved in conversion between standard unit 1 and standard unit 2
unit_notes	Notes on the source of units
unit_factor	Name of the conversion factor
unit_factor_type	Type of the conversion factor (experimental - for factors which are affected by experimental design; drug - factors which are different for each drug; conventional - standard conversion factors between different systems of measurements; formulation - conversion factors that depend on drug formulation; physiological - factors which depend on physiological parameters of studied population; analyte - factors which depend on the analyte)
unit_factor_value	Typical values of the factors
unit_factor_description	Description of the conversion factor
