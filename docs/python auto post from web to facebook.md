Here’s a basic guide on how to set it up:

### Steps:

1. **Create a Facebook Developer Account:**
   - Go to the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a developer account if you don't already have one.

2. **Create a Facebook App:**
   - In the Facebook Developer Portal, create a new app.
   - Choose "For Everything Else" as the app type.

3. **Get Access Token:**
   - In the app’s settings, navigate to "Tools" > "Graph API Explorer."
   - Generate a User Access Token or a Page Access Token (for posting to a page).
   - The token will allow you to make API calls to Facebook on behalf of your account or page.

4. **Install Required Libraries:**
   You'll need `requests` and `facebook-sdk` libraries for interacting with Facebook’s API. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests facebook-sdk
   ```

5. **Write Python Code to Post:**

Here’s an example code to automatically post to Facebook:

```python
import requests

# Replace with your access token
access_token = 'your_access_token'
page_id = 'your_page_id'  # Only required for pages
message = "This is a test post from Python!"

# Graph API URL for posting a message
url = f'https://graph.facebook.com/{page_id}/feed'

# Data to send in the POST request
data = {
    'message': message,
    'access_token': access_token
}

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, data=data)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Post successful!")
else:
    print("Error: " + response.text)
```

### Notes:
- Replace `'your_access_token'` with the actual access token you generated.
- Replace `'your_page_id'` with the ID of the page you want to post to (you can find this in the Page's settings or by using the API).
- The `message` variable contains the text you want to post.
- This example uses a simple text post, but you can also add media like images by extending the parameters in the request.

### Handling Authentication and Permissions:
To post to a Facebook page, the access token must have the `publish_pages` and `manage_pages` permissions, which need to be granted through Facebook’s OAuth process. Make sure to follow Facebook’s API documentation on authentication and permissions if you are working with a production app.
