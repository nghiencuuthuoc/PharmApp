To rename an environment in Conda, you can follow these steps:

1. **Activate the environment** you want to rename:
   ```bash
   conda activate old_env_name
   ```

2. **Create a clone** of the environment with the new name:
   ```bash
   conda create --name new_env_name --clone old_env_name
   ```

3. **Deactivate** the environment:
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```

4. **Remove the old environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   conda remove --name old_env_name --all
   ```

This will effectively rename the environment by cloning it and removing the old one.
