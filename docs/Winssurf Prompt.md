Create a local cache of the page results so that we aren't rerunning the retrieval logic for the same category.


Create a webpage that loads data from the results cache (if available, otherwise computes the frequencies from scratch) and displays a word cloud where the sizes of the words are proportional to frequency. Use HTML, JavaScript, and Flask.

Create a ColorPalette class that would contain 6 hex colors, and a bunch of common color palettes that extend it.

Integrate @get_all_color_palettes into the word cloud app. Make the color palettes selectable in a dropdown and display the colors being used.

Add raw frequencies to the app as shown in the image.
