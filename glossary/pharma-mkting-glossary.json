Adverse drug reactions are classified into six types (with mnemonics): dose-related (Augmented), non-dose-related (Bizarre), dose-related and time-related (Chronic), time-related (Delayed), withdrawal (End of use), and failure of therapy (Failure). Timing, the pattern of illness, the results of investigations, and rechallenge can help attribute causality to a suspected adverse drug reaction. Management includes withdrawal of the drug if possible and specific treatment of its effects. Suspected adverse drug reactions should be reported.

They are prominently featured in the labeling of drugs to warn prescribers about serious adverse reactions or special problems. [Boxed warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning)s are displayed on a drug's package insert, in the Physicians' Desk Reference, on the FDA's Web site, and on the Web sites of drug marketing companies. Physicians are required to provide patients with information about relevant risks, but they can use professional judgment to decide whether to prescribe a drug with a boxed warning.\r\n\r\nSource: American Family Physician, [FDA Boxed Warnings: How to Prescribe Drugs Safely](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0201/p298.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomists and physicians have thoroughly studied the effects of FDA boxed warnings on prescription patterns. It is not necessarily true that a physician and patient will have a conversation about a drug's boxed warning after it is issued.[3] For instance, an FDA-mandated boxed warning decreased rosiglitazone use by 70%, but that still meant 3.8 million people were given the drug. Later research indicated that after receiving an FDA advisory, there was a decrease in rosiglitazone use, due to a combined effect of media exposure, advisory, and scientific publications, whereas pioglitazone (with a similar advisory) did not similarly decrease in use. This challenges the idea that physicians and patients will have a conversation after a boxed warning is issued. Throughout the country, boxed warnings will be translated into prescription patterns differently by different physicians.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia, Boxed warning."

      "key": "Bookend Ad",
      "content": "FDA has from time to time seen manufacturers use \"bookend\" advertisements in print or broadcast formats. These advertisements consist of two parts: (1) a \"reminder\" advertisement, which includes the name of a drug or device but makes no safety or effectiveness claims; and (2) a disease awareness message encouraging consumers to seek health care practitioner assistance in identifying and treating a particular health condition but does not mention any product by name. Neither component alone would be subject to FDA rules for requiring risk disclosure. But taken together, FDA is concerned that they are understood by consumers as product claim advertisements, without the inclusion of proper disclosure of required risk information.\r\n\r\nThe draft guidance therefore provides advice to manufacturers on the criteria FDA uses in determining whether bookend advertisements are subject to regulation as product claim advertisements. The criteria, in brief, are whether the two components are perceptually distinct and whether they are separated in space or time. FDA requests comment on these two criteria.\r\n\r\nArticle: \"[FDA Draft Guidance for Print DTCA: Less than Feared](https://www.pharma-mkting.com/news/pmn32-article03.html)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFDA may treat ads as labeling or advertising: \"when the communication is presented in combination with reminder promotion or product claim promotion in a way that causes the audience to perceive the two pieces as one advertisement or promotional labeling piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"For example, some drug firms have broadcast help-seeking advertisements in combination with perceptually similar reminder advertisements, separated only by a brief period containing unrelated intervening matter. When considered in isolation, the help-seeking advertisement conveys the message, 'There is help for a particular medical condition; see your doctor,' As discussed above, this advertisement would be neither labeling nor advertising and thus would not be subject to the requirements under the act for the disclosure of risk and other information. The perceptually similar reminder advertisement, by itself, conveys the message, 'This specific product is available; see your doctor.' As discussed above, this advertisement would be exempted by regulation from the requirements for disclosure of risk or other information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Together, however, these two advertisements communicate information about a treatable disease or health condition and the name of a product approved for treatment of a disease or health condition, and effectively constitute an advertisement that communicates a productÂ’s indication and efficacy for a certain medical condition without providing risk and other information. If a disease awareness or help-seeking piece and a reminder advertisement are presented in a manner that causes their messages to be linked together by the audience, the failure of the combined communication to include the risk and other information required under the act and FDA regulations would cause the advertised product to be misbranded.\""

An example would be ads for \"overactive bladder,\" which have been successful in building awareness among consumers of a medical condition (urinary incontinence or urgency) that many thought was only of concern for senior citizens.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, disease awareness communications are communications disseminated to consumers or health care practitioners that discuss a particular disease or health condition, but do not mention any specific drug or device or make any representation or suggestion concerning a particular drug or device. Help-seeking communications are disease awareness communications directed ato consumers.\r\n\r\nFDA believes that disease awareness communications can provide important health information to consumers and health care practitioners, and can encourage consumers to seek, and health care practitioners to provide, appropriate treatment. This is particularly important for under-diagnosed, under-treated health conditions, such as depression, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes.

Activities range from educating department members, seeing that consumer questions are addressed, and providing informational services to health care providers in the community. Medical affairs also formulates publications plans, and the reporting of pivotal trial results to the FDA, at scientific meetings and through journal articles.\r\n\r\n2. Regulatory review - medical affairs works with regulatory affairs and the legal department to insure that all written documents are accurate and adhere to the guidelines mandated by the FDA. All educational, technical and promotion materials are reviewed.\r\n\r\n3. Liaison to health care professionals and professional organizations, and disease state advocacy groups. Medical affairs works to support the efforts of professional associations, patient support groups, and educational foundations.\r\n\r\n4. Thought leader development -- this involves providing information and other supports to persons who are recognized experts in their fields.\r\n\r\n5.

Supporting marketing -- medical affairs provides the scientific input and expertise in the design and construction of all promotional materials and events. At the least, materials are reviewed by medical affairs for scientific accuracy. Medical affairs officers may also present relevant scientific information at marketing functions.\r\n\r\n7. R & D -- depending on the structure of a company, medical affairs may also be responsible for all stages of clinical development including study design, initiation and monitoring. Medical affairs also may oversee the dispersal of funds and /or study drugs for investigator initiated trials.\r\n\r\n8. Post market drug safety functions - in some companies medical affairs handles drug safety, reviewing individual adverse event reports, aggregate adverse event statistics, and sometimes even talking with customers about drug safety. (In some firms, these tasks fall under the egis of regulatory affairs).\r\n\r\n9. Medical liaison - many companies have teams of medical liaison reps (MLRs) who are often field based medical information specialists, providing in depth drug and disease state information to health providers in their territories.

But, most of the time, patients have already learned of the drug via advertising and demand a prescription.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the term is better applied to physicians as when they first interact with a pharma sales rep about an Rx product and are asked if they would prescribe the drug to their patients.\r\n\r\nThere are several variations of this term:\r\n\r\n \tSecond Moment of Truth - also coined by P&G\r\n \tThird Moment of Truth\r\n \tZero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) - coined by Google\r\n \tBSMOT - coined by PharmaGuy: Can you guess the meaning?\r\n\r\nWhere to find more information:\r\n\r\n \t[Marketing: The 4 Moments of Truth](http://heidicohen.com/marketing-the-4-moments-of-truth-chart/).\r\n \t[Chart](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/22025485652718395/)\r\n \t[Forget ROI! - Pharma must measure return on engagement](http://sco.lt/70MDLN)"

This requires deployment of appropriate information technology to gain a common view of customers across the different channels. The multichannel marketer must have the resources to coordinate messages reaching customers through these channels and to measure the effectiveness of each channel in reaching customers. The communications must appear seamless to customers.\r\n\r\nWhen the marketing messages and/or channels are changed or modified in response to data collected from previous communications (ie, effectiveness, ROI, etc.), it is called \"closed-loop marketing.\"\r\n\r\nReference: Rangaswamy, Arvind; Gerrit H.

Once therapy has been initiated, patients and their insurers are likely to continue to pay for the new, costly drugs.\r\n\r\nWhere to find more information:\r\n\r\n \tPrescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987.\r\n \t[Pharmaceutical Samples: A Toolkit for Academic Medical Centers](http://www.prescriptionproject.org/tools/initiatives_resources/files/0012.pdf) (pdf).\r\n \tPMN Article: [Free Drug Samples: The Sales Rep's Last Great Hope?](http://www.news.pharma-mkting.com/pmn79-article01.htm).\r\n \tPMN Survey Results: [Should Free Drug Samples Be Banned?](http://www.surveys.pharma-mkting.com/BanDrugSamples.htm).\r\n \tPMN Article: [Intelligent Online Sampling Strategies](http://www.news.pharma-mkting.com/pmn34-article01.html)."

One metric used is the total number of prescriptions (TRx; Total Prescriptions) written by physicians for a particular drug over a specific period of time. This includes prescriptions for refills and renewals, which are scripts patients get when they run out of refills. In contrast, NRx (New Prescriptions) do NOT include refills but DO include renewals.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical companies purchase physician-level prescribing data from companies such as IMS. These data guide pharma salesforce strategies. For example, drug companies can save money by distributing free samples of a new drug only to the biggest prescribers of products in that same class. Sales reps can also use the data to verify their physician clients have prescribed the drugs as promised during sales calls. That information would cahnge the sales messaging in followup calls.\r\n\r\nArticle: \"[The New Written Prescription](https://www.pharma-mkting.com/news/pmn33-article06.html)\"\r\n\r\nArticle: \"[Whose Data Is It Anyway?](http://www.news.pharma-mkting.com/pmn56-article04.pdf)\" (pdf)\r\n\r\nSurvey: [Pharma Use of Rx Data Survey](http://www.surveys.pharma-mkting.com/rxdatause.htm)"

Untitled Letters are intended to cover those circumstances where the Agency has a need to communicate with regulated industry about violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance. The three types of letters related to licensed products that are issued by CBER and CDER, pursuant to section 6.3 of these procedures, do not necessarily fall within this definition of an Untitled Letter; however, they are still Untitled Letters that are covered by the scope of these procedures.\r\n\r\nUntitled Letters are less serious than the more widely-known Warning Letters, which indicate that failure to take action will lead to regulators taking enforcement action. Instead, the Untitled Letter calls for a correction (typically in an advertisement or other promotional material), but almost always stops short of indicating that enforcement action will be forthcoming if changes aren't made.\r\n\r\nWhere to find more information:\r\n\r\n \tSource: [FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual March 2010](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/RegulatoryProceduresManual/UCM176965.pdf) (pdf)\r\n \tAudio source: [FDA BadAd Program](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/DrugMarketingAdvertisingandCommunications/ucm209384.htm)"

Typically, a Warning Letter notifies a responsible individual or firm that the Agency considers one or more products, practices, processes, or other activities to be in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), its implementing regulations and other federal statutes. Warning Letters should only be issued for violations of regulatory significance, i.e., those that may actually lead to an enforcement action if the documented violations are not promptly and adequately corrected.
