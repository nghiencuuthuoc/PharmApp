"W","Water Hammer","
     A tremendous force produced by rapid interruption of linear flow of a
    non-compressible fluid. Most commonly occurs when fast acting valves are
    closed in a high flow liquid system.

"W","Water Treatment","
     Water treatment, also referred to as water conditioning, can consist of
    adding or removing chemicals to change the properties of water. In water
    softening, for example, sodium ions are substituted for metallic ions that
    cause ""hardness"" thus reducing the scale-forming tendencies of
    water. Water purification on the other hand, always consists of removing
    undesirable impurities.

"W","Waviness","
     The more widely spaced component of surface texture. Unless otherwise
    noted, waviness includes all irregularities whose spacing is greater than
    the roughness sampling length. Waviness may result from such factors as
    machine or work deflection, vibration, chatter, heat treatment or warping
    strains. Roughness may be considered as superimposed on a ""wavy""
    surface.

     WFI is water purified by distillation or by reverse osmosis, it contains no
    added substance. WFI meets the purity requirements under Purified Water.
    Although not intended to be sterile, it meets a test for a limit of
    bacterial endotoxin. It must be produced, stored, and distributed under
    Sterile Water for Injection.
