Sterilizing the\n    system by making use of a wide spectrum of light within the transfer\n    chamber.\n     4. One Shot Systems: basically, two halves coming together. Similar to an\n    Alpha Beta port but simpler, cheaper, and capable of only a single\n    connection.\n     5. Heat Welded Bag Systems: passed in or passed out using a continuous\n    polyethylene liner which is heat sealed and cut to maintain the integrity of\n    the internal and external environments.\n     6. Steam Sterilized: the liquid component or powder path is clean steam\n    sterilized after connection and prior to transfer.\n     7. Autoclave/Depyrogenation/Dryheat: pass through for batch. Use of\n    conventional autoclave to sterilize a canister provided with an Alpha Beta\n    port and filters to allow the passage of steam and safe aspiration on\n    cooling. Depyrogenation/Dryheat uses dry heat to sterilize and at sufficient\n    temperature depyrogenate components, typically glassware, in a batch oven\n     8. Depyrogenation Tunnel: standard volume glassware entry.\n    Depyrogenation/Dry heat uses dry heat to sterilize and at sufficient\n    temperature to depyrogenate components, typically glassware, in a tunnel\n    allowing continuous input.\n     \n    "

There\n      are four biosafety levels for operations performed with infectious agents:\n      \n\n    \n    \n      1. BL1: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for\n        work performed with defined and characterized strains of viable\n        microorganisms not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans. The\n        Basic Laboratory. This laboratory provides general space in which work\n        is done with viable agents that are not associated with disease in\n        healthy adults. Conventional laboratory designs are adequate. Areas\n        known to be source of general contamination, such as animal rooms and\n        waste staging areas, should not be adjacent to patient care activities.\n        Public areas and general offices to which non-laboratory staff requires\n        frequent access should be separated from spaces, that primarily support\n        laboratory functions.\n\n      2. BL2: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for\n        work performed with a broad spectrum of moderate risk agents present and\n        associated with human disease of varying severity. The Basic Laboratory.\n        This laboratory provides general space in which work is done with viable\n        agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adults.\n        Conventional laboratory designs are adequate. Areas known to be sources\n        of general contamination, such as animal rooms and waste staging areas,\n        should not be adjacent to patient care activities. Public areas and\n        general offices to which non-laboratory staff requires frequent access\n        should be separated from spaces, which primarily support laboratory\n        functions.\n\n      3. BL3: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for\n        work performed with indigenous or exotic agents where the potential for\n        infection by aerosols is real and the disease may have serious or lethal\n        consequences. Just walking through the area and breathing the air could\n        infect one. The Containment Laboratory. This laboratory has special\n        engineering features that make it possible for laboratory workers to\n        handle hazardous materials without endangering themselves, the\n        community, or the environment. The unique features that distinguish this\n        laboratory from the basic laboratory are the provisions for access\n        control and a specialized ventilation system. The containment laboratory\n        may be an entire building, a single module, or complex of modules within\n        a building. In all cases, a controlled access zone from areas open to\n        the public separates the laboratory.\n\n      4. BL4: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for\n        work performed with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high\n        individual risk of life-threatening disease. Exposure to the skin could\n        cause infection. The Maximum Containment Laboratory. This laboratory has\n        special engineering and containment features that allow activities\n        involving infectious agents that are extremely hazardous to the\n        laboratory worker or that may cause serious epidemic disease to be\n        conducted safely. Although the maximum containment laboratory is\n        generally a separate building, it can be constructed as an isolated area\n        within the building. The laboratory's distinguishing characteristic is\n        that it has secondary barriers to prevent hazardous materials from\n        escaping into the environment. Such barriers include sealed openings\n        into the laboratory, airlocks or liquid disinfectant barriers, a\n        clothing-change and shower room contiguous to the laboratory, a double\n        door autoclave, a biowaste treatment system, and a treatment system to\n        decontaminate exhaust air.\n    \n    \n      (also see: Good Large Scale Practice, Containment Level, and Table\n        II, Section II - Comparison of Good Large Scale Practice (GLSP) and\n        Biosafety Level (BL) - Large Scale (LS) Practice)\n\n      "

The\n      individual substances thus obtained can be identified or determined by\n      analytical methods. There are several types of chromatography in use with\n      different operating principles: \n    \n    \n      1. Adsorption - separates products by their different affinities for\n        the surface of a solid medium, either an inorganic carrier such as\n        silica gel, alumina, or hydroxyapatite, or an organic polymer.\n      2. Ion Exchange - uses ion exchange resin to which ionized functional\n        groups have been attached. At an appropriate pH, target proteins acquire\n        a net surface charge that allows them to selectively bind to an ion\n        exchange resin. Other impurities are eluted through the column.\n      3. Gel Filtration - employs a neutral cross-linked carrier with a\n        defined pore size for molecular fractionation. Molecules larger than the\n        largest pores cannot enter the matrix and pass directly through the\n        column; smaller molecules enter the carrier and are retarded. Gel\n        filtration thus separates on the basis of molecular size, eluting larger\n        molecules first, followed by progressively smaller species.\n      4. Affinity - relies on the propensity of each biomolecule to have an\n        affinity for another highly specific biomolecule, such as an\n        antibody-antigen relationship. Once bound together, the drug molecules\n        can be detached by altering various chemical attributes in the column.\n      5. Hydrophobic - separates by molecule polarity and reverse\n        interaction with water.\n      6. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-\n    \n    \n      "

Category D Fluid Service: A fluid service in which all the\n        following apply: (a) the fluid handled is nonflammable, nontoxic, and\n        not damaging to human tissues (see definition below). (b) The design\n        gage pressure does not exceed 1035 kPA (150 psi). (c) The design\n        temperature is from -29°C (-20°F) through 186°C (366°F).\n\n      2. Category M Fluid Service: A fluid service in which the potential\n        for personnel exposure is judged to be significant and in which a single\n        exposure to a very small quantity of a toxic fluid, caused by leakage\n        can produce serious irreversible harm to persons upon breathing or\n        bodily contact, even when prompt restorative measures are taken.\n\n      3.

Normal Fluid Service: A fluid service pertaining to most piping\n        covered by ASME B31.3, i.e., not subject to the rules for Category D,\n        Category M, or High Pressure Fluid Service, and not subject to severe\n        cyclic conditions.\n\n    \n    \n      Damaging to human tissues for the purpose of the Code, describes a\n        fluid service in which exposure to the fluid, caused by leakage under\n        expected operating conditions, can harm skin, eyes, or exposed mucous\n        membranes so that irreversible damage may result unless prompt\n        restorative measures are taken.

Inoculum Preparation: The aim is to develop for the production\n        stage fermentation a pure inoculum in sufficient volume and in the\n        fast-growing (logarithmic) phases so that a high population density is\n        obtained. This is accomplished through a seed fermentation train.\n      2. The Medium: This is designed to provide the microorganism with all\n        the nutrients it requires. Provision is usually made to add nutrients\n        during fermentation.\n      3. Oxygen Supply: An adequate supply of oxygen is required. As oxygen\n        is only slightly soluble in water, a number of methods are used to make\n        oxygen more readily available to the microorganisms in the broth,\n        including sparging, mechanical agitators, and dispersion baffles in the\n        fermenter tank.\n      4. Temperature Control: Heat is generated both by the metabolism of\n        nutrients and by the power dissipated in stirring and has to be removed\n        by controlled cooling. Tank jackets or internal coils are used to\n        control temperature.\n      5. Antifoam Agents: Microbiological systems that are vigorously\n        stirred and aerated usually produce foam. Excessive foam cannot be\n        tolerated and so provisions have to be made for adding antifoam agents.\n      6. Harvesting: This is the removal of the cells from the broth. This\n        can be accomplished by cross-flow filtration or centrifugation.\n      7. Cell Lysis: With E. coli fermentations, the product protein is\n        contained within the cell in the form of an inclusion body.\n        High-pressure homogenizers are often used to chop up the E. coli\n        bacteria into fine fragments, liberating the inclusion bodies for\n        further processing.\n      8. Purification: This is the separation of the desired product from\n        the other constituents in the harvested broth. Various processes\n        including refolding, ultrafiltration/diafiltration, centrifugation, and\n        chromatographic columns are employed to purify the product.\n      Mapping\n    \n\n    \n      "

      "content": "\n       There are more than 70 standard types of stainless steel and many special\n      alloys. These steels are produced in the wrought form (AISI types) and as\n   cast alloys (ACI types). Generally, all are iron based, with 12 to 30\n      percent chromium, 0 to 22 percent nickel, and minor amounts of carbon,\n      columbium, copper, molybdenum, selenium, tantalum, and titanium. There are\n      three groups of wrought stainless steels: \n      1. Martensitic Alloys: characteristically\n        magnetic and hardenable by heat treatment are oxidation resistant. They\n        are exemplified by Type 410 (UNS S41000). Contain 12 to 20 percent\n        chromium with controlled amount of carbon and other additives. Their\n        corrosion resistance is inferior to austenitic stainless steels, and is\n        generally used in mildly corrosive environments and for cutlery, turbine\n        blades, and high-temperature parts.\n      2. Ferritic Stainless: characteristically\n        magnetic but not hardenable by heat treatment. Contain 15 to as much as\n        30 percent Cr with low carbon content (0.1 percent). The higher chromium\n        content improves its corrosive resistance. Type 430 (UNS S43000) widely\n        used in nitric acid plants is a typical example. Corrosion resistance is\n        rated good, although ferritic alloys are not good against reducing acids\n        such as HCl.\n      3. Austenitic Stainless: widely\n        used in bioprocessing, are characteristically non-magnetic, not\n        hardenable by heat treatment, and are the most corrosion resistant of\n        the three groups. These steels contain 16 to 26 percent chromium, 6 to\n        22 percent nickel. Carbon is kept low (0.08 percent) to minimize carbide\n        precipitation. To avoid precipitation, special stainless steels\n        stabilized with titanium, columbium, or tantalum, have been developed\n        (types 321, 347, 348). Another approach to the problem is the use of\n        low-carbon steels such as 304L and 316L, with 0.03 percent maximum\n        carbon. Type 302 is the basic alloy of this group. Types 304 (UNS\n        S30400) and 304L are low-carbon versions of 302. Types 316 (UNS S31600),\n        316L, and 317 (UNS S31700), with 2.5 to 3.5 percent molybdenum, are the\n        most corrosion resistance.\n      Cast Stainless Alloys: are widely used in pumps, valves, and\n        fittings. All corrosion resistant alloys have the letter C plus a second\n        letter (A to N) denoting increasing nickel content. Numerals indicate\n        maximum carbon. Typical members of this group are CF-8, similar to 304\n        stainless, CF-8M, similar to 316, and CD-4M Cu, which has improved\n        resistance to nitric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids.\n      "
