A,Adequate Provision,"An alternative way for drug companies to provide risk information about a drug in a broadcast ad. Drug companies generally must include all of a drug's risk information in a product claim ad. In print ads, they usually do this in the ""brief summary."" This brief summary would take many minutes to read or scroll down a TV screen. The law allows broadcast ads to include only the most important risk information if the ads tell viewers or listeners how to get the full FDA-approved prescribing information, which has all the drug's risks. To meet the ""adequate provision"" requirement, the broadcast ad must provide ways to find the drug's FDA-approved prescribing information.

Broadcast ads can meet the ""adequate provision"" requirement by giving a number of sources for finding a drug's prescribing information. These include:

 	A healthcare provider (for example, a doctor)
 	A toll-free telephone number
 	The current issue of a magazine that contains a print ad
 	A Web site address

A,Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR),"An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking a medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of ""side effect"", as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury. An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown.

 	Source: [Adverse drug reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction)

An adverse drug reaction is ""an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product."" Such reactions are currently reported by use of WHO's Adverse Reaction Terminology, which will eventually become a subset of the International Classification of Diseases. Adverse drug reactions are classified into six types (with mnemonics): dose-related (Augmented), non-dose-related (Bizarre), dose-related and time-related (Chronic), time-related (Delayed), withdrawal (End of use), and failure of therapy (Failure). Timing, the pattern of illness, the results of investigations, and rechallenge can help attribute causality to a suspected adverse drug reaction. Management includes withdrawal of the drug if possible and specific treatment of its effects. Suspected adverse drug reactions should be reported. Surveillance methods can detect reactions and prove associations.

A,Adverse Event (AE),"The definition of ""adverse event"" for both prescription drugs and dietary supplements is ""any health-related event associated with the use of a that is adverse"". This could include any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease, and, more seriously, death.


FDA defines an Adverse drug experience as ""Any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from drug overdose whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from drug abuse; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.""

FDA's MedWatch Form, which is used by physicians and consumers to report adverse events, includes the following outcomes attributed to adverse events:

 	

 	

 	Death
 	Life-threatening
 	Hospitalization
 	Disability or permanent damage
 	Congenital abnormality
 	Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage


The FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to monitor and report all adverse events it learns about relating to its products. The agency expects ""entities responsible for reporting will promptly review all adverse event information received or otherwise obtained, which potentially includes information from the Internet and social media tools.""


Such events should be reported to FDA if there is knowledge of the four basic elements for submission of an individual case safety report, namely:

 	

 	

 	An identifiable patient
 	An identifiable reporter
 	A suspect drug or biological product
 	An adverse experience or fatal outcome suspected to be due to the suspect drug or biological product


FDA guidance states that those entities should review any Internet sites sponsored by them for adverse experience information, but are not responsible for reviewing any Internet sites that they do not sponsor; however, if they become aware of an adverse experience on an Internet site that they do not sponsor, they should review the adverse experience and determine if it should be reported to FDA.

A,Adverse Event Report (AER),"FDA requires manufacturers, packers, and distributors of marketed prescription drug products to establish and maintain records and make reports to FDA of all serious, unexpected adverse drug experiences associated with the use of their drug products. Pharma companies must also develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences to FDA.

FDA law requires pharmaceutical companies to periodically report any adevrse events it has knowledge of. Before considering any clinical incident for submission to the FDA in an expedited or periodic safety report, applicants, manufacturers, and licensed manufacturers should have knowledge of the following four dats elements:

 	An identifiable patient;
 	And identifiable reporter;
 	A suspect drug, biological product, or device; and
 	An adverse event or fatal outcome.

According to the FDA, ""Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the productsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations"" (see ""Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS)"").

A,Awareness,"Relating to a stage in a patient's behaviorial progression with regard to a medical condition in which the patient is just finding out about the condition and whether it pertains to him or her.

Addiction recovery programs often refer to three stages of behavior leading to recovery: Awareness, Acceptance, and Action. This progression may be called ""The Three A's"" and is used as a tool to help people come to terms with their addiction.

The same behaviorial progression is seen with patients coming to terms with a chronic medical condition.

Patients need different information from prospects and marketing messages need to change as prospects go through the behavioral progression starting at Awareness (just finding out about the condition and whether it pertains to them), moving to Acceptance (the potential risk has been personalized and the prospect is considering seeking information and/or evaluation), and finally arriving at Action (ready to talk with physician about treatment or is already on therapy).

Pharmaceutical marketers often use the term ""Disease Awareness"" and try to increase the market size of a therapeutic area by using DTC advertising and physician marketing to ""build"" awareness of a particular medical condition. An example would be ads for ""overactive bladder,"" which have been successful in building awareness among consumers of a medical condition (urinary incontinence or urgency) that many thought was only of concern for senior citizens.""letter",key,content,,,,
B,Biosimilar,"The term biosimilar refers to biologic products that are marketed after expiration of patents, which are claimed to have similar properties to existing biologic products. Due to the complexity of biologics, a product can only be made that is similar, but not identical.",,,,,,
B,Black Box Warning,"Drugs that have special problems, particularly ones that may lead to death or serious injury, may have this warning information displayed within a box in the prescribing information. This is often referred to as a ""boxed"" or ""black box"" warning. Drugs that have such boxed warnings are not permitted to have reminder ads.

Source: FDA Glossary; [Drug Advertising - A Glossary of Terms](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/PrescriptionDrugAdvertising/ucm072025.htm)



A boxed warning, commonly referred to as a ""black box"" warning, is the most serious type of warning mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are prominently featured in the labeling of drugs to warn prescribers about serious adverse reactions or special problems. [Boxed warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning)s are displayed on a drug's package insert, in the Physicians' Desk Reference, on the FDA's Web site, and on the Web sites of drug marketing companies. Physicians are required to provide patients with information about relevant risks, but they can use professional judgment to decide whether to prescribe a drug with a boxed warning.

Source: American Family Physician, [FDA Boxed Warnings: How to Prescribe Drugs Safely](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0201/p298.html).



Economists and physicians have thoroughly studied the effects of FDA boxed warnings on prescription patterns. It is not necessarily true that a physician and patient will have a conversation about a drug's boxed warning after it is issued.[3] For instance, an FDA-mandated boxed warning decreased rosiglitazone use by 70%, but that still meant 3.8 million people were given the drug. Later research indicated that after receiving an FDA advisory, there was a decrease in rosiglitazone use, due to a combined effect of media exposure, advisory, and scientific publications, whereas pioglitazone (with a similar advisory) did not similarly decrease in use. This challenges the idea that physicians and patients will have a conversation after a boxed warning is issued. Throughout the country, boxed warnings will be translated into prescription patterns differently by different physicians.

Source: Wikipedia, Boxed warning.",,,,,,
B,Bookend Ad,"FDA has from time to time seen manufacturers use ""bookend"" advertisements in print or broadcast formats. These advertisements consist of two parts: (1) a ""reminder"" advertisement, which includes the name of a drug or device but makes no safety or effectiveness claims; and (2) a disease awareness message encouraging consumers to seek health care practitioner assistance in identifying and treating a particular health condition but does not mention any product by name. Neither component alone would be subject to FDA rules for requiring risk disclosure. But taken together, FDA is concerned that they are understood by consumers as product claim advertisements, without the inclusion of proper disclosure of required risk information.

The draft guidance therefore provides advice to manufacturers on the criteria FDA uses in determining whether bookend advertisements are subject to regulation as product claim advertisements. The criteria, in brief, are whether the two components are perceptually distinct and whether they are separated in space or time. FDA requests comment on these two criteria.

Article: ""[FDA Draft Guidance for Print DTCA: Less than Feared](https://www.pharma-mkting.com/news/pmn32-article03.html)""



FDA may treat ads as labeling or advertising: ""when the communication is presented in combination with reminder promotion or product claim promotion in a way that causes the audience to perceive the two pieces as one advertisement or promotional labeling piece.""

""For example, some drug firms have broadcast help-seeking advertisements in combination with perceptually similar reminder advertisements, separated only by a brief period containing unrelated intervening matter. When considered in isolation, the help-seeking advertisement conveys the message, 'There is help for a particular medical condition; see your doctor,' As discussed above, this advertisement would be neither labeling nor advertising and thus would not be subject to the requirements under the act for the disclosure of risk and other information. The perceptually similar reminder advertisement, by itself, conveys the message, 'This specific product is available; see your doctor.' As discussed above, this advertisement would be exempted by regulation from the requirements for disclosure of risk or other information.""

""Together, however, these two advertisements communicate information about a treatable disease or health condition and the name of a product approved for treatment of a disease or health condition, and effectively constitute an advertisement that communicates a productÃ‚â€™s indication and efficacy for a certain medical condition without providing risk and other information. If a disease awareness or help-seeking piece and a reminder advertisement are presented in a manner that causes their messages to be linked together by the audience, the failure of the combined communication to include the risk and other information required under the act and FDA regulations would cause the advertised product to be misbranded.""",,,,,,
B,"Brand, Brand Marketing","The American Marketing Association defines a brand as ""a name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers."" Walter Landor, who helped create and develop such famous brands as Coca-Cola, defined a brand as a ""promise."" ""By identifying and authenticating a product or service, it delivers a pledge of satisfaction and quality.""

Brand marketing focuses on communicating the brand message to drive awareness and affect attitude.

B,Brick-level Sales Data,"A brick-level sales data system is a way of organizing sales data on a regional basis, with a ""brick"" referring to a small geographical area consisting of at least four or five pharmacies. Pharmaceutical companies use brick-level data for various purposes including measuring the effectiveness of their salespeople and designing incentives schemes.

Data service companies like IMS Health and NDC organize the data into ""bricks."" The pharmaceutical companies, in turn, organize their sales forces and incentive programs according to that brick structure. For example, a salesperson's territory may consist of several bricks and market shares are often tracked according to bricks.",,,,,,
B,Brief Summary,"The ""brief summary"" includes all the risk information about a prescription drug and is generally based on the prescribing information. The brief summary may leave out non-risk information, such as the chemical description of the drug, how it works in the body, and directions for using it. For direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads, FDA recommends that brief summaries be written in language that consumers can understand.

""Brief Summary"" is the technical name for the detailed information that appears in ads for prescription drugs. The law requires that print ads making claims about a drug (product claim ads) include a ""brief summary"" with all the risks listed in the drug's ""prescribing information"" and at least one FDA-approved use of the drug. The brief summary generally includes:

 	Who should not take the drug
 	When the drug should not be taken
 	Possible serious side effects of the drug and, if known, what can be done to lower the chance of having them
 	Frequently occurring, but not necessarily serious, side effects

The ""brief summary"" includes a lot of information, so it is usually presented on its own page of a print ad. The brief summary may leave out non-risk information, such as the chemical description of the drug, how it works in the body, and directions for using it.

An example would be ads for ""overactive bladder,"" which have been successful in building awareness among consumers of a medical condition (urinary incontinence or urgency) that many thought was only of concern for senior citizens.

According to the FDA, disease awareness communications are communications disseminated to consumers or health care practitioners that discuss a particular disease or health condition, but do not mention any specific drug or device or make any representation or suggestion concerning a particular drug or device. Help-seeking communications are disease awareness communications directed ato consumers.

FDA believes that disease awareness communications can provide important health information to consumers and health care practitioners, and can encourage consumers to seek, and health care practitioners to provide, appropriate treatment. This is particularly important for under-diagnosed, under-treated health conditions, such as depression, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Unlike drug and device promotional labeling and prescription drug and restricted device advertising, disease awareness communications are not subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations.

According to this act, the manufacturer or distributor of a drug subject may distribute drug samples by mail or common carrier to practitioners licensed to prescribe such drugs or, at the request of a licensed practitioner, to pharmacies of hospitals or other health care entities. The recipient of the drug sample must execute a written receipt for the drug sample upon its delivery and the return of the receipt to the manufacturer or distributor.

According to the Prescription Project: Samples serve two distinct marketing purposes. (1) Physicians value samples and are willing to spend time with sales representatives to get them. (2) Secondly, samples serve as ""starter"" medications -- an enticement to prescribe new, heavily marketed and generally more expensive medications. Once therapy has been initiated, patients and their insurers are likely to continue to pay for the new, costly drugs.

C,Complete Response Letter,"Under new regulations that govern the drug approval process, FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) will no longer issue ""approvable"" or ""not approvable"" letters when a drug application is not approved. Instead, CDER will issue a ""complete response"" letter at the end of the review period to let a drug company know of the agency's decision on the application.

""These new regulations will help the FDA adopt a more consistent and neutral way of conveying information to a company when we cannot approve a drug application in its present form,"" said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). ""Thorough and timely review of drug applications is a priority of the FDA, and these new processes will make our communications with sponsors of applications more consistent.""

Taking the place of ""approvable"" and ""not approvable"" letters, a ""complete response"" letter will be issued to let a company know that the review period for a drug is complete and that the application is not yet ready for approval. The letter will describe specific deficiencies and, when possible, will outline recommended actions the applicant might take to get the application ready for approval.

Currently, when assessing new drug applications, the FDA can respond to a sponsor in one of three types of letters: an ""approval"" letter, meaning the drug has met agency standards for safety and efficacy and the drug can be marketed for sale in the United States; an ""approvable"" letter, which generally indicates that the drug can probably be approved at a later date provided that the applicant provides certain additional information or makes specified changes (such as to labeling); or a ""not approvable"" letter, meaning the application has deficiencies generally requiring the submission of substantial additional data before the application can be approved.

""Complete response"" letters are already used to respond to companies that submit biologic license applications. The process for drugs and biologics will be consistent under the new regulations.

Today, health care professionals more commonly use the terms ""adherence"" to or ""concordance"" with a regimen rather than ""compliance"", because these terms are thought to more accurately reflect the diverse reasons for patients not following treatment directions in part or in full. However, the preferred terminology remains a matter of debate. In some cases, concordance is used to refer specifically to patient adherence to a treatment regimen that is designed collaboratively by the patient and physician, to differentiate it from adherence to a physician only prescribed treatment regimen.Despite the ongoing debate, adherence is the preferred term for the World Health Organization, The American Pharmacists Association, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health Adherence Research Network."" -- Source: Wikipedoia

Continuing medical education consists of educational activities which serve to maintain, develop, or increase the knowledge, skills, and professional performance and relationships that a physician uses to provide services for patients, the public, or the profession. The content of CME is that body of knowledge and skills generally recognized and accepted by the profession as within the basic medical sciences, the discipline of clinical medicine, and the provision of health care to the public.

A broad definition of CME, such as the one found above, recognizes that all continuing educational activities which assist physicians in carrying out their professional responsibilities more effectively and efficiently are CME. A course in management would be appropriate CME for physicians responsible for managing a health care facility; a course in educational methodology would be appropriate CME for physicians teaching in a medical school; a course in practice management would be appropriate CME for practitioners interested in providing better service to patients.

Not all continuing educational activities which physicians may engage in however are CME. Physicians may participate in worthwhile continuing educational activities which are not related directly to their professional work and these activities are not CME. Continuing educational activities which respond to a physician's non-professional educational need or interest, such as personal financial planning or appreciation of literature or music, are not CME.

CME that discusses issues related to coding and reimbursement in a medical practice falls within ACCME's definition of CME.

All CME educational activities developed and presented by a provider accredited by the ACCME system and associated with AMA PRA Category 1 Creditâ„?must be developed and presented in compliance with all ACCME accreditation requirements -- in addition to all the requirements of the AMA PRA program. All activities so designated for, or awarded, credit will be subject to review by the ACCME accreditation process as verification of fulfillment of the ACCME accreditation requirements.

C,Corrective Direct-to-Consumer Advertising,"FDA regulations require prescription drug ads to contain accurate information about the benefits and risks of the drug advertised. When this is not the case, corrective advertising is designed to dissipate or correct erroneous beliefs resulting from a false claim. Corrective advertising emerged in public debate in the United States in the 1970s as a hypothetical remedy for deceptive advertising, having first been proposed by Georgetown University law students in 1969 as a way of dispelling the effects of deceptive advertising.

Corrective advertising is one remedy FDA may request in response to false or misleading prescription drug promotion. In 2009, for example, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals produced and aired corrective DTC advertising for Yaz, a birth control pill, following a warning from FDA regarding misleading claims.

C,Customer Relationship Management (CRM),"Customer relationship management is a term that refers to practices, strategies and technologies that companies use to manage and analyze customer interactions and data.
The CRM approach tries to analyze data about customers' history with a company, in order to better improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on retaining customers, in order to drive sales growth. One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile information from a range of different channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials, social media, and more.

F,Fair Balance,"In direct-to-consumer advertising, fair balance refers to the presentation of accurate and fair assessment of the risks as well as the benefits of the drug.

[T]he presentation of true information relating to side effects and contraindications is comparable in depth and detail with the claims for effectiveness or safety.""



""The FDA should make clear that the fair balance requirement for DTC ads prohibits only ads that convey a deceptive impression of the risk and benefits from the overall presentation of information, rather than those that fail to achieve a mechanistic balance between risk and benefit information because they do not present such information with identical emphasis.""

""Although a mechanical application of the fair balance standard ensures proportionality between benefit and risk information, it could unnecessarily restrict the ability of advertisers to present truthful, non-misleading claims. For example, if a mechanistic approach were adopted, an advertisement might violate the fair balance requirement if it presented benefits clearly and conspicuously in 24-point type and presented risk information clearly and conspicuously in 18- point type. Such an ad may not be Ã‚â€œfairly balancedÃ‚â€?in terms of format, but it may, nevertheless, effectively communicate both benefit and risk information to consumers. Ads lacking in fair balance thus do not necessarily mislead or otherwise injure consumers.74 On the other hand, an ad might present benefit and risk information in the same size and font, but it would be misleading if it discussed only minor risks without disclosing significant side effects.

""The FTC staff recommends that the FDA clarify that, in interpreting and applying the fair balance requirement, the FDA prohibits only ads that convey a deceptive impression of the risk or benefits of a drug from the overall presentation of information, rather than those that fail to achieve a mechanistic balance between risk and benefit information.""

G,Guidance (FDA),"FDA ""guidance"" represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration on a topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An FDA regulation, on the other hand, carries the weight of law.

FDA issues guidance documents -- ie, publishes them in the Federal Register -- usualy after doing research, which can include holding public hearings.

There may be several phases to issuing or publishing guidance, including:

 	Publish Intent in Federal Register
 	Although NOT Required, Hold a Public Hearing
 	Have a Public Comment Period
 	Review Comments Submitted to Docket
 	Issue DRAFT Guidance
 	Collect & Review Comments on DRAFT Guidance
 	Revise DRAFT Guidance Based on Comments, If Necessary and Issue FINAL Guidance

All the above steps are typical of ""Level 1"" guidances, which discuss changes in interpretation or policy that are more than of a minor nature, include complex scientific issues, and/or covers highly controversial issues. ""Level 2"" gudiance, which sets forth existing practices or minor changes in interpretation or policy (e.g., easy to figure out, not controversial). do not need to be issued as a draft for comments.

I,Important Safety Information (ISI),"FDA requires that drug [product claim Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) ads](http://www.glossary.pharma-mkting.com/product-claim-DTC.htm) must include ""All the risks of using the drug."" Under certain circumstances, however, ads can give only the most important risks. This is referred to as ""Important Safety Information"" or ISI for short.

In broadcast radio and TV ads (and telephone), ISI is referred to as the ""major statement,"" which consists of the drug's most important risks. The major statement must be presented in a clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner. The risks are generally similar to the risks required for ""fair balance"" in print ads.

Omission or minimization of risk information is the most frequent violation of the regulations cited in advertising and promotion enforcement letters sent to sponsors, and illustrative research in one of the areas this guidance covers, direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising, has shown that 60 percent of patients believe ads directed at them do not provide enough information about risks, 60 percent of physicians believe that patients have little or no understanding from these ads about what the possible risks and negative effects of the products are, and 72 percent of physicians believe that patients have little or no understanding from these ads about who should not use the product.

 	""Phase II"" trials are designed to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition.
 	""Phase III"" trials, are intended to gather additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug.

Many drugs, like chemotherapy for an example, have deeply deleterious -- sometimes even fatal -- side effects, and part of the FDA approval process is weighing the potentiality for those side effects against the disease process the drug is designed to treat. The sponsor's goal at the end of the IND process is an approved New Drug Application (""NDA"").

In contrast, TRx (Total Prescriptions) includes refills AND renewals.

Pharmaceutical companies purchase physician-level prescribing data from companies such as IMS. These data guide pharma salesforce strategies. For example, drug companies can save money by distributing free samples of a new drug only to the biggest prescribers of products in that same class. Sales reps can also use the data to verify their physician clients have prescribed the drugs as promised during sales calls. That information would change the sales messaging in followup calls.

The huge drug market has set in motion a competition among pharmaceutical firms. This has meant that as soon as a prototype drug becomes available several other similarly active compounds immediately follow. These followers are usually called ""me-too drugs"". Me-too drugs can be broadly defined as chemically related to the prototype, or other chemical compounds which have an identical mechanism of action. This increasing marketing of me-too drugs has been questioned, so pharmaceutical firms are justifying the development of not-so-innovative drugs. The most common arguments can be summarized as follows: me-too drugs offer an improvement on the efficacy of the prototype; they show a different profile of adverse effects; they are effective in patients resistant to the prototype; they improve compliance in long-term treatment; they are less expensive than the prototype.

M,Medical Affairs,"Most pharmaceutical companies have two kinds of scientific teams: research / development and medical affairs. While R & D defines the scientific direction and early stage development, medical affairs provides scientific support for late stage development and post market support for drugs and devices.

Medical affairs usually functions alongside marketing, to provide technical support to both internal teams and external customers. So what kinds of tasks are involved?

1. Informational services - the scientists and physicians working in medical affairs generally act as disease experts. Activities range from educating department members, seeing that consumer questions are addressed, and providing informational services to health care providers in the community. Medical affairs also formulates publications plans, and the reporting of pivotal trial results to the FDA, at scientific meetings and through journal articles.

2. Regulatory review - medical affairs works with regulatory affairs and the legal department to insure that all written documents are accurate and adhere to the guidelines mandated by the FDA. All educational, technical and promotion materials are reviewed.

3. Liaison to health care professionals and professional organizations, and disease state advocacy groups. Medical affairs works to support the efforts of professional associations, patient support groups, and educational foundations.

4. Thought leader development -- this involves providing information and other supports to persons who are recognized experts in their fields.

5. Educational meeting support -- in the ""olden"" days, pharmaceutical companies actually wrote, staffed and sponsored continuing medical education events. Educational meeting support now only can be provided in the form of unrestricted educational grants.

6. Supporting marketing -- medical affairs provides the scientific input and expertise in the design and construction of all promotional materials and events. At the least, materials are reviewed by medical affairs for scientific accuracy. Medical affairs officers may also present relevant scientific information at marketing functions.

7. R & D -- depending on the structure of a company, medical affairs may also be responsible for all stages of clinical development including study design, initiation and monitoring. Medical affairs also may oversee the dispersal of funds and /or study drugs for investigator initiated trials.

8. Post market drug safety functions - in some companies medical affairs handles drug safety, reviewing individual adverse event reports, aggregate adverse event statistics, and sometimes even talking with customers about drug safety. (In some firms, these tasks fall under the egis of regulatory affairs).

9. Medical liaison - many companies have teams of medical liaison reps (MLRs) who are often field based medical information specialists, providing in depth drug and disease state information to health providers in their territories. They function as colleagues and experts in their fields. (Note that some companies may employ medical sales liaisons (MSLs) who, while providing services like MLSs, work within the marketing department)

M,Moment of Truth (MOT),"The term ""Moment of Truth"" (MOT) or ""First Moment of Truth"" (commonly called FMOT) was coined by Procter & Gamble in 2005 to define the first interaction between a shopper and a product on a store's shelf. This moment was considered one of the most important marketing opportunities for a brand, as P&G asserted -- and others believed -- that shoppers make up their mind about a product in the first few seconds after they encounter that product for the first time.

This consumer-packaged goods term has been used by pharmaceutical marketers even though consumers are not confronted with Rx drug products ""on a store's shelf."" Therefore, a nuanced definition is needed. Perhaps it's the moment when the doctor informs a consumer/patient that he/she should be prescribed the drug. But, most of the time, patients have already learned of the drug via advertising and demand a prescription.

Perhaps the term is better applied to physicians as when they first interact with a pharma sales rep about an Rx product and are asked if they would prescribe the drug to their patients.

There are several variations of this term:

 	Second Moment of Truth - also coined by P&G
 	Third Moment of Truth
 	Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) - coined by Google
 	BSMOT - coined by PharmaGuy: Can you guess the meaning?

Multichannel pharma marketing refers to the use of multiple synchronized communication channels to reach consumers, patients, and physicians with marketing communications or information at the appropriate point in their decision cycles.

The critical aspect of multichannel marketing is the synchronization of messages across channels. This requires deployment of appropriate information technology to gain a common view of customers across the different channels. The multichannel marketer must have the resources to coordinate messages reaching customers through these channels and to measure the effectiveness of each channel in reaching customers. The communications must appear seamless to customers.

When the marketing messages and/or channels are changed or modified in response to data collected from previous communications (ie, effectiveness, ROI, etc.), it is called ""closed-loop marketing.""

""An unlabeled use [off-label use] of a drug is a use that is not included as an indication on the drug's label as approved by the FDA."" Source: Medicare.



Once a new prescription drug has been approved by the FDA, and prescriptions have been written and used by patients, patients and professionals may discover that there are additional symptoms or conditions the drug may treat effectively that were not among the reasons the drug was originally approved.

Knowing about these different ways the drug may be effective, a doctor may decide to prescribe the drug for one of these alternative reasons. Such a prescription is considered to be ""off-label."" The drug does not need to go through the FDA process for the off-label prescription.

In particular, generic drugs that have been in use for many years may be discovered to have alternative uses.

In the US, it is legal for doctors to write off-label prescriptions. However, it is not legal for pharmaceutical companies to promote any drugs they manufacture for off-label use. They may promote the use of drugs only for the reasons the drug was approved.

Pharma companies have hired patients as spokespeople (see ""[Behrman Wasn't the First Patient Spokesperson Paid Big Bucks By BMS](http://tinyurl.com/ybpsfma)""), given grants to patient advocacy groups (see ""[Pharma Dollars (Pounds, Euros) are Grassroots Seeds](http://tinyurl.com/24vnfuc)""), recruited individual patients to participate in market research focus groups (see ""[Levitra Market Research: The Interview](http://tinyurl.com/27fh68u)""), and now may be hiring individual patients to monitor, moderate, or participate in online patient forums (see ""[J&J Agents Trolling for Adverse Events on the Internet](http://tinyurl.com/l4wqtf)"").

P,Pay-for-Delay,"In a ""pay-for-delay"" agreement between a brand-name drug manufacturer and a potential generic competitor, a patent holder (the brand-name manufacturer) agrees to pay a large sum of money to an accused infringer (its would-be competitor), and the competitor agrees that it will no longer challenge the patent and will not enter the market for a specified period of time.Source: [Petition for a Writ of Certiorari](http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-416-watsonpetition.pdf)



Brand-name pharmaceutical companies can delay generic competition that lowers prices by agreeing to pay a generic competitor to hold its competing product off the market for a certain period of time. These so-called ""pay-for-delay"" agreements have arisen as part of patent litigation settlement agreements between brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies.

Pay-for-delay agreements appear in some settlements of patent litigation between brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies. That patent litigation usually takes place within the framework for generic entry established by the Hatch-Waxman Act.

Under that Act, a generic competitor may seek entry prior to expiration of the patents on a brand-name drug. Generic drug entry before patent expiration can save consumers billions of dollars. Generics have an incentive to challenge brand patents because the first generic to file its application can obtain 180 days of marketing exclusivity during which it is the only generic on the market. To seek FDA approval for entry before patent expiration, a generic must declare that its product does not infringe the relevant patents or that the relevant patents are invalid. Typically, brand-name pharmaceutical companies challenge the generic's declaration, and litigation ensues between the brand-name and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to determine whether the relevant patents are valid and infringed. For the brand to prevail and block entry, it must successfully defend the validity of its patents and demonstrate that the generic's product would infringe those patents. In 2002, the FTC issued a study showing that generics prevailed in 73% of the patent litigation ultimately resolved by a court decision between 1992 and June 2002.

Given the costs and potential uncertainty of patent litigation, brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies sometimes settle their patent litigation before a final court decision.

P,Product Hopping,"""Product Hopping"" is a tactic by which brand name pharmaceutical companies can try to obstruct generic competitors and preserve monopoly profits on a patented drug by making modest reformulations that offer little or no therapeutic advantages. Prior to facing generic competition, a brand drug company can, for example, simply withdraw its original product, forcing consumers to switch to the reformulated brand drug and enabling the branded company to keep its market exclusivity and preventing consumers from obtaining the benefits of generic competition.

This ""product-hop"" may succeed despite the fact that consumers would not likely choose the new product. As the FTC states: ""In the pharmaceutical industry Ã¢â‚¬Â?the success of a product-switching scheme does not depend on whether consumers prefer the reformulated version of the product over the original, or whether the reformulated version provides any medical benefit.""

R,REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy),"In 2007, a new law that gave FDA many new authorities and responsibilities to enhance drug safety was enacted. It's called the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act- sometimes called ""FDAAA""- and one of its provisions gave FDA the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy-(REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks.

A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is a strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. A REMS will be required if FDA finds that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug or biological product outweigh the risks of the product, and FDA notifies the sponsor. A REMS can include a Medication Guide, Patient Package Insert, a communication plan, elements to assure safe use, and an implementation system, and must include a timetable for assessment of the REMS.

A REMs may be required by the FDA as part of the approval of a new product, or for an approved product when new safety information arises. Essentially, a REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. Since medicines are very different from each other, each REMS for each medicine is also different.

R,Reverse Payment,"In a ""reverse payment"" agreement between a brand-name drug manufacturer and a potential generic competitor, a patent holder (the brand-name manufacturer) agrees to pay a large sum of money to an accused infringer (its would-be competitor), and the competitor agrees that it will no longer challenge the patent and will not enter the market for a specified period of time.Source: [Petition for a Writ of Certiorari](http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-416-watsonpetition.pdf)



Brand-name pharmaceutical companies can delay generic competition that lowers prices by agreeing to pay a generic competitor to hold its competing product off the market for a certain period of time. These so-called ""pay-for-delay"" agreements have arisen as part of patent litigation settlement agreements between brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies.

Pay-for-delay agreements appear in some settlements of patent litigation between brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies. That patent litigation usually takes place within the framework for generic entry established by the Hatch-Waxman Act.

Under that Act, a generic competitor may seek entry prior to expiration of the patents on a brand-name drug. Generic drug entry before patent expiration can save consumers billions of dollars. Generics have an incentive to challenge brand patents because the first generic to file its application can obtain 180 days of marketing exclusivity during which it is the only generic on the market. To seek FDA approval for entry before patent expiration, a generic must declare that its product does not infringe the relevant patents or that the relevant patents are invalid. Typically, brand-name pharmaceutical companies challenge the generic's declaration, and litigation ensues between the brand-name and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to determine whether the relevant patents are valid and infringed. For the brand to prevail and block entry, it must successfully defend the validity of its patents and demonstrate that the generic's product would infringe those patents. In 2002, the FTC issued a study showing that generics prevailed in 73% of the patent litigation ultimately resolved by a court decision between 1992 and June 2002.

Given the costs and potential uncertainty of patent litigation, brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies sometimes settle their patent litigation before a final court decision. For example, the parties may agree that the generic can enter at some time before the patent's expiration date, but not as soon as the generic seeks through its litigation

T,Total Prescriptions (TRx),"Precise measurement of pharma marketing's impact requires physician presciption (Rx) data. One metric used is the total number of prescriptions (TRx; Total Prescriptions) written by physicians for a particular drug over a specific period of time. This includes prescriptions for refills and renewals, which are scripts patients get when they run out of refills. In contrast, NRx (New Prescriptions) do NOT include refills but DO include renewals.

Pharmaceutical companies purchase physician-level prescribing data from companies such as IMS. These data guide pharma salesforce strategies. For example, drug companies can save money by distributing free samples of a new drug only to the biggest prescribers of products in that same class. Sales reps can also use the data to verify their physician clients have prescribed the drugs as promised during sales calls. That information would cahnge the sales messaging in followup calls.

S,Sampling,"Sampling (ie, Drug Sampling) is the process by which pharmaceutical companies distribute free drugs (Drug Samples) to physicians. According to the [Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987](http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/PrescriptionDrugMarketingActof1987/ucm201702.htm), the term ""drug sample"" means a unit of a drug, which is not intended to be sold and is intended to promote the sale of the drug. According to this act, the manufacturer or distributor of a drug subject may distribute drug samples by mail or common carrier to practitioners licensed to prescribe such drugs or, at the request of a licensed practitioner, to pharmacies of hospitals or other health care entities. The recipient of the drug sample must execute a written receipt for the drug sample upon its delivery and the return of the receipt to the manufacturer or distributor.

According to the Prescription Project: Samples serve two distinct marketing purposes. (1) Physicians value samples and are willing to spend time with sales representatives to get them. (2) Secondly, samples serve as ""starter"" medications -- an enticement to prescribe new, heavily marketed and generally more expensive medications. Once therapy has been initiated, patients and their insurers are likely to continue to pay for the new, costly drugs.

U,Untitled Letter,"An FDA Untitled Letter is an initial correspondence with regulated industry that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of a Warning Letter. Untitled Letters are intended to cover those circumstances where the Agency has a need to communicate with regulated industry about violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance. The three types of letters related to licensed products that are issued by CBER and CDER, pursuant to section 6.3 of these procedures, do not necessarily fall within this definition of an Untitled Letter; however, they are still Untitled Letters that are covered by the scope of these procedures.

Untitled Letters are less serious than the more widely-known Warning Letters, which indicate that failure to take action will lead to regulators taking enforcement action. Instead, the Untitled Letter calls for a correction (typically in an advertisement or other promotional material), but almost always stops short of indicating that enforcement action will be forthcoming if changes aren't made.
