            material, are prepared at one of the three standard temperatures: 50°,
            70°, and 121°. Therefore, the class designation of a
            plastic must be accompanied by an indication of the temperature of
            extraction e.g., IV - 121°, which represents a class IV plastic
            extracted at 121°).

B,Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs),"
       Bench-top or freestanding cabinets with unidirectional airflow used for
      handling materials that present a health hazard. The National Institutes
      of Health (NIH) Guidelines classify them as: 

    
    
      1. Class I - A negative pressure, ventilated cabinet for personnel
        protection having an inward flow of air away from the operator. The
        exhaust air is filtered through a HEPA filter (located at rear or top)
        either into the laboratory or to the outside. This cabinet is designed
        for general microbiological research with low and moderate risk agents
        (BL-2 and BL-3 agents), and is used in three operational modes:
        

          a) With a full width open front. The face velocity of the inward
            flow of air through the full width open front is at least 75' feet
            per minute.

          b) With an installed front closure panel (having four 6-inch
            diameter openings) without gloves. The face velocity of the inward
            flow of air through the openings will increase to approximately 150'
            feet per minute.

          c) With an installed front closure panel equipped with arm-length
            rubber gloves, and inlet air pressure relief for further protection.
            In this configuration, it is necessary to install a make-up air
            inlet fitted with a HEPA filter in the cabinet.

         
      2. Class II - A ventilated cabinet for personnel and product
        protection having an open front with inward airflow for personnel
        protection (75' to 100' feet per minute), and HEPA filtered downward
        unidirectional airflow for product protection. The exhaust air is
        filtered through a HEPA filter for environmental protection. For
        selection and procurement of Class II cabinets refer to standards
        developed by the National Sanitation Foundation, Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
        Cabinets are further classified as:
        

          a) Type A - Suitable for microbiological research in the absence
            of volatile or toxic chemicals and radionuclides (BL-2 and BL-3),
            with 70% recirculated air through HEPA. They are exhausted through
            HEPA into the laboratory or to the outdoors via a ""thimble""
            connection to the building exhaust system.

          b) Type B - Hard ducted to the building exhaust system, contains
            negative pressure plena, and face velocity of 100' feet per minute.
            Type B cabinets are further sub-typed into types: B1 (30%
            recirculated air through HEPA; exhaust via HEPA and hard ducted. BL2
            and BL-3), B2 (No recirculation; total exhaust via HEPA and hard
            ducted. BL-2 and BL-3), and B3 (same as IIA, but plena under
            negative pressure to room and exhaust air is ducted. BL-2 and BL-3).
          Classes I and II should be located away from traffic patterns and
            doors, airflow from fans, room air supply louvers, and other air
            moving devices.

         
      3. Class III - Closed-front ventilated cabinet of gas tight
        construction that provides the highest level of personnel protection
        from infectious aerosols, as well as protection of research materials
        from microbiological contaminants. The interior of the cabinet is
        protected from contaminants exterior to the cabinet. The cabinet is
        fitted with arm-length rubber gloves and is operated under negative
        pressure of at least 0.5 inches water gauge. All supply air is filtered
        through HEPA filters. Exhaust air is filtered through two HEPA filters
        in series or one HEPA filter and incinerator before being discharged to
        the outside environment. Class III cabinets are most suitable for work
        with hazardous agents that require Biosafety Level 3 or 4 containment.
        Cabinets must be connected to a double-door autoclave and/or chemical
        dunk tank used to sterilize or disinfect all materials exiting the
        cabinet, and to allow supplies to enter the cabinet.

      are four biosafety levels for operations performed with infectious agents:
      

    
    
      1. BL1: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for
        work performed with defined and characterized strains of viable
        microorganisms not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans. The
        Basic Laboratory. This laboratory provides general space in which work
        is done with viable agents that are not associated with disease in
        healthy adults. Conventional laboratory designs are adequate. Areas
        known to be source of general contamination, such as animal rooms and
        waste staging areas, should not be adjacent to patient care activities.
        Public areas and general offices to which non-laboratory staff requires
        frequent access should be separated from spaces, that primarily support
        laboratory functions.

      2. BL2: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for
        work performed with a broad spectrum of moderate risk agents present and
        associated with human disease of varying severity. The Basic Laboratory.
        This laboratory provides general space in which work is done with viable
        agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adults.
        Conventional laboratory designs are adequate. Areas known to be sources
        of general contamination, such as animal rooms and waste staging areas,
        should not be adjacent to patient care activities. Public areas and
        general offices to which non-laboratory staff requires frequent access
        should be separated from spaces, which primarily support laboratory
        functions.

      3. BL3: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for
        work performed with indigenous or exotic agents where the potential for
        infection by aerosols is real and the disease may have serious or lethal
        consequences. Just walking through the area and breathing the air could
        infect one. The Containment Laboratory. This laboratory has special
        engineering features that make it possible for laboratory workers to
        handle hazardous materials without endangering themselves, the
        community, or the environment. The unique features that distinguish this
        laboratory from the basic laboratory are the provisions for access
        control and a specialized ventilation system. The containment laboratory
        may be an entire building, a single module, or complex of modules within
        a building. In all cases, a controlled access zone from areas open to
        the public separates the laboratory.

      4. BL4: Practices, safety equipment, and facilities appropriate for
        work performed with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high
        individual risk of life-threatening disease. Exposure to the skin could
        cause infection. The Maximum Containment Laboratory. This laboratory has
        special engineering and containment features that allow activities
        involving infectious agents that are extremely hazardous to the
        laboratory worker or that may cause serious epidemic disease to be
        conducted safely. Although the maximum containment laboratory is
        generally a separate building, it can be constructed as an isolated area
        within the building. The laboratory's distinguishing characteristic is
        that it has secondary barriers to prevent hazardous materials from
        escaping into the environment. Such barriers include sealed openings
        into the laboratory, airlocks or liquid disinfectant barriers, a
        clothing-change and shower room contiguous to the laboratory, a double
        door autoclave, a biowaste treatment system, and a treatment system to
        decontaminate exhaust air.

C,Centrifuge,"
       A centrifuge operates on the principle of centrifugal force, the inertial
      reaction by which a body tends to move away from a center about which it
      revolves. This technique is commonly used to separate solids from liquids
      or liquids of different densities. Centrifugal equipment is divided into
      two major types, sedimenters and filters:  ",,
C,Sedimenters,"
       For sedimentation, batch and continuous centrifuges are available. There
      are three types of centrifuges for continuous sedimentation. 
    
    
      a) Disc - constructed on the vertical axis, disc centrifuges are
        solid-bowl units. All are capable of separating liquids from solids,
        solids from two immiscible liquids and two immiscible liquids.
        Disc-stack centrifuges differ in their ability to handle different
        volumes of solids in the feed stream, and in the way that the separated
        solids are removed from the separation vessel: solids-retaining,
        solids-ejecting, and nozzle-bowl separators.
      b) Decanters - consists of a cylindrical settling section with a
        tapered end. Inside the bowl is a scroll conveyor that is driven usually
        at a slightly faster rate than the bowl and can be controlled by a
        differential speed device or back drive.
      c) Tubular - a vertical solid-wall cylinder provided with caps on
        both ends; a tubular centrifuge generally has a bottom feed inlet. When
        two liquids of different specific gravities are fed, the heavier phase
        is concentrated against the wall, while the lighter phase ""floats""
        on the heavier phase.
    
    
    Filters
    
      Filtering centrifuges accommodate a range of liquid-solid
        separations. The two batch types, basket and peeler centrifuges, can
        separate almost any liquid-solid slurry. For continuous operation, there
        are pusher and conical centrifuges.
        
          a) Pusher - with a horizontal axis, the pusher centrifuge
            operates at a constant fixed speed. It has a perforated bowl,
            generally with a bar-type screen. One end of the bowl is open while
            the opposite end is closed with a reciprocating diaphragm, or disc,
            which rotates with the bowl.
          b) Conical - the standard conical centrifuge consists of a cone
            with a small closed end and a large open end to which is attached a
            coarsely woven drainage screen, topped with a filter screen or
            perforated plate. A compartmentalized casing surrounds the bowl.
            There are two variations of the basic conical centrifuge: the
            tilting conical centrifuge and the conveyor conical type.

       Procedure by which solutes (e.g., proteins and other chemical products)
      are selectively separated by a dynamic differential migration process in a
      system consisting of two or more phases, one of which moves continuously
      in a given direction and in which the individual substances exhibit
      different mobilities by reason of differences in adsorption, partition,
      solubility, vapor pressure, molecular size, or ionic charge density. The
      individual substances thus obtained can be identified or determined by
      analytical methods. There are several types of chromatography in use with
      different operating principles: 
    
    
      1. Adsorption - separates products by their different affinities for
        the surface of a solid medium, either an inorganic carrier such as
        silica gel, alumina, or hydroxyapatite, or an organic polymer.
      2. Ion Exchange - uses ion exchange resin to which ionized functional
        groups have been attached. At an appropriate pH, target proteins acquire
        a net surface charge that allows them to selectively bind to an ion
        exchange resin. Other impurities are eluted through the column.
      3. Gel Filtration - employs a neutral cross-linked carrier with a
        defined pore size for molecular fractionation. Molecules larger than the
        largest pores cannot enter the matrix and pass directly through the
        column; smaller molecules enter the carrier and are retarded. Gel
        filtration thus separates on the basis of molecular size, eluting larger
        molecules first, followed by progressively smaller species.
      4. Affinity - relies on the propensity of each biomolecule to have an
        affinity for another highly specific biomolecule, such as an
        antibody-antigen relationship. Once bound together, the drug molecules
        can be detached by altering various chemical attributes in the column.
      5. Hydrophobic - separates by molecule polarity and reverse
        interaction with water.

      investigation of a previously untested drug is generally divided into
      three phases: 
    
    
      1. Phase I: Introducing the product (or drug) into a small number,
        generally 20 to 80, patients or healthy volunteers to determine the
        drug's metabolism, pharmacological actions, and side effects associated
        with increasing doses.
      2. Phase II: introducing the product (or drug) into a small number,
        generally no more than several hundred, patients with the disease or
        condition under study to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug, common
        short-term side effects and risks associated with its use.
      3. Phase III: Introducing the product (or drug) into several hundred
        to several thousand subjects. Studies are expanded controlled and
        uncontrolled trials performed after preliminary evidence suggesting
        effectiveness of the drug has been obtained. If the results of the Phase
        III Clinical Trials are favorable, then the FDA will normally license
        the drug for manufacture and sale. This phase is usually performed using
        double blind studies with a placebo and the actual drug.
      4. Phase IV: Ongoing testing studies conducted after the drug is
        approved. This is done to ensure the long-term efficacy of the drug,
        detect any long-term beneficial and/or detrimental side effects, and to
        determine additional potential uses for the drug

    dissolution in an electrolyte flowing solution with an imposed electrical
    current. When the proper combination of electrolyte current &
    temperature is attained, the high points of surface irregularities, or high
    current density areas, are selectively removed at a greater rate than the
    remainder of the surface, resulting in improved surface smoothness. During
    electropolishing, the polarized surface film is subjected to the combined
    effects of gassing (oxygen) that occurs with electromechanical metal
    removal, saturation of the surface with dissolved metal, and the agitation
    and temperature of the electrolyte.

    ",,
M,Manufacturing Process (Biotechnology),"
     The basic processes for rDNA fermentation and purification normally include
    the following steps:
    

      1. Inoculum Preparation: The aim is to develop for the production
        stage fermentation a pure inoculum in sufficient volume and in the
        fast-growing (logarithmic) phases so that a high population density is
        obtained. This is accomplished through a seed fermentation train.
      2. The Medium: This is designed to provide the microorganism with all
        the nutrients it requires. Provision is usually made to add nutrients
        during fermentation.
      3. Oxygen Supply: An adequate supply of oxygen is required. As oxygen
        is only slightly soluble in water, a number of methods are used to make
        oxygen more readily available to the microorganisms in the broth,
        including sparging, mechanical agitators, and dispersion baffles in the
        fermenter tank.
      4. Temperature Control: Heat is generated both by the metabolism of
        nutrients and by the power dissipated in stirring and has to be removed
        by controlled cooling. Tank jackets or internal coils are used to
        control temperature.
      5. Antifoam Agents: Microbiological systems that are vigorously
        stirred and aerated usually produce foam. Excessive foam cannot be
        tolerated and so provisions have to be made for adding antifoam agents.
      6. Harvesting: This is the removal of the cells from the broth. This
        can be accomplished by cross-flow filtration or centrifugation.
      7. Cell Lysis: With E. coli fermentations, the product protein is
        contained within the cell in the form of an inclusion body.
        High-pressure homogenizers are often used to chop up the E. coli
        bacteria into fine fragments, liberating the inclusion bodies for
        further processing.
      8. Purification: This is the separation of the desired product from
        the other constituents in the harvested broth. Various processes
        including refolding, ultrafiltration/diafiltration, centrifugation, and
        chromatographic columns are employed to purify the product.

      normally most hazardous in the form of powders and have been divided into
      the following three categories: 
    

    
      1. Biologically Hazardous additives are compounds that when
        contacting a living cell, will alter, endanger, or damage the cell in
        some shape or form. These should be treated as requiring total
        containment.
      2. Chemically Hazardous additives are compounds that when coming into
        contact with an oxidant, will cause harm to its surroundings due to
        reaction and/or oxidation. These products usually require containment
        and/or blanketing with an inert gas.
      3. General Intermediates are compounds that are neither biologically
        nor chemically hazardous additives but they will cause a housekeeping
        problem. They usually require dusting prevention.

P,Passivation,"
       A final chemical treatment/cleaning process that removes exogenous iron
      or iron compounds from the surface of stainless steel piping and equipment
      by the use of a mild oxidant, such as a nitric acid solution, or by ""in-situ

P,Passive Layer,"
       A passive oxidized film that forms naturally on a stainless steel surface
      when exposed to air or similar oxidizing environment thus protecting the
      underlying base metal from corrosion. Welding disturbs the passive layer
      by reducing the chromium and increasing the iron, thus altering the
      chromium/iron ratio (measure of corrosion resistance). Upon completion and
      approval of the weld, the weld surface and adjacent boundary area must be
      brought back to a passive state. Additionally, normal operating conditions
      in typical Water For Injection, reverse osmosis, deionized water, clean
      steam, Clean In Place, and process piping often lead to formation of the
      most prevalent form of self catalyzing corrosion called ""rouge""
      (French for red), which is a colloidal form of rust containing iron oxide,
      chromium and nickel in various forms. This problem is further accentuated

S,Stainless Steel,"
       There are more than 70 standard types of stainless steel and many special

   cast alloys (ACI types). Generally, all are iron based, with 12 to 30
      percent chromium, 0 to 22 percent nickel, and minor amounts of carbon,
      columbium, copper, molybdenum, selenium, tantalum, and titanium. There are
      three groups of wrought stainless steels: 
      1. Martensitic Alloys: characteristically
        magnetic and hardenable by heat treatment are oxidation resistant. They
        are exemplified by Type 410 (UNS S41000). Contain 12 to 20 percent
        chromium with controlled amount of carbon and other additives. Their
        corrosion resistance is inferior to austenitic stainless steels, and is
        generally used in mildly corrosive environments and for cutlery, turbine
        blades, and high-temperature parts.
      2. Ferritic Stainless: characteristically
        magnetic but not hardenable by heat treatment. Contain 15 to as much as
        30 percent Cr with low carbon content (0.1 percent). The higher chromium
        content improves its corrosive resistance. Type 430 (UNS S43000) widely
        used in nitric acid plants is a typical example. Corrosion resistance is
        rated good, although ferritic alloys are not good against reducing acids
        such as HCl.
      3. Austenitic Stainless: widely
        used in bioprocessing, are characteristically non-magnetic, not
        hardenable by heat treatment, and are the most corrosion resistant of
        the three groups. These steels contain 16 to 26 percent chromium, 6 to
        22 percent nickel. Carbon is kept low (0.08 percent) to minimize carbide
        precipitation. To avoid precipitation, special stainless steels
        stabilized with titanium, columbium, or tantalum, have been developed
        (types 321, 347, 348). Another approach to the problem is the use of
        low-carbon steels such as 304L and 316L, with 0.03 percent maximum
        carbon. Type 302 is the basic alloy of this group. Types 304 (UNS
        S30400) and 304L are low-carbon versions of 302. Types 316 (UNS S31600),
        316L, and 317 (UNS S31700), with 2.5 to 3.5 percent molybdenum, are the
        most corrosion resistance.
      Cast Stainless Alloys: are widely used in pumps, valves, and
        fittings. All corrosion resistant alloys have the letter C plus a second
        letter (A to N) denoting increasing nickel content. Numerals indicate
        maximum carbon. Typical members of this group are CF-8, similar to 304
        stainless, CF-8M, similar to 316, and CD-4M Cu, which has improved
        resistance to nitric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids.

      Vitamin
      Term coined in 1911 (vita, Latin word for life, and the chemical term
        amine) by polish biochemist, Casimir Funk, represents one of a group of
        organic substances, some of which are of unknown composition, present in
        minute amount in natural foodstuffs which are essential to normal
        metabolism. A lack of which in the dietary causes deficiency diseases.
        Vitamins are commonly classified into two groups, the fat-soluble, and
        the water-soluble. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble. Vitamin C
        and members of the vitamin B complex group are water-soluble. In
        general, the vitamins play catalytic and regulatory roles in the body's
        metabolism. Among the water-soluble vitamins, the B vitamins apparently
        function as coenzymes. Vitamin's C coenzyme role, if any, has not been
        established. Part of the importance of vitamin C to the body may result
        from its strong antioxidant action. The actions of the fat-soluble
        vitamins are less well understood. Some of them, too, may contribute to
        enzyme activity, and some of them are essential to the functioning of
        cellular membranes.
