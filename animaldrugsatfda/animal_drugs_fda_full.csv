The petition also requested that FDA deny Fermenta Animal Health Company's ANADA for an oxytetracycline product. Pfizer pointed out that the Fermenta ANADA does not contain tissue residue studies for calculation of a withdrawal period. *Note: Six points raised in the petition were addressed. The Agency agreed that demonstration of in vivo bioequivalence between the Fermenta and Pfizer formulations is essential to the approval of Fermenta's ANADA. The Agency did not agree that tissue residue studies necessarily would be required. The pharmacokinetic profiles of both formulations will be evaluated to determine bioequivalence and could be used in lieu of a tissue residue study in assigning a withdrawal period. The Agency agreed that bioequivalence studies would be required in more than one species but it does not intend to require demonstration of bioequivalence in all classes of animals within a species. Bioequivalence studies in the Fermenta ANADA will be required in swine and in one class of adult ruminating nonlacting cattle. The Agency agreed that the Fermenta product, although a different strength, must be labeled to deliver the same dose of oxytetracycline base to the animal. The Agency retracted a statement made in approving the Fermenta suitability petition requesting that the generic product be labeled at 9.3 milligrams per pound of body weight. Fermenta will be instructed to label their generic product at 9 milligrams per pound of body weight. The Agency pointed out that although different salts of oxytetracycline are used in the manufacture of the two products, the finished form of active ingredient in both cases is magnesium chelated oxytetracycline.
