# Animal Drugs @ FDA
## Information
Animal Drugs @ FDA refers to the regulation and approval of animal drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of veterinary drugs and feed additives used in animals.  This includes:

* Pre-Approval Review:  Before a new animal drug can be marketed in the U.S., the manufacturer must submit a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) to the CVM. This application includes extensive data demonstrating the drug's safety and effectiveness.  The CVM reviews this data to determine whether the drug meets their standards.

* Post-Market Surveillance: After approval, the CVM continues to monitor the safety of animal drugs through post-market surveillance activities, including adverse event reporting and inspections of manufacturing facilities.

* Regulation of Veterinary Drugs: The FDA regulates not only the active pharmaceutical ingredients but also the manufacturing processes, labeling, and marketing claims for animal drugs.  They set standards for drug quality, purity, and potency to ensure that they meet specific requirements.

* Feed Additives:  The CVM also regulates feed additives that are used to enhance animal growth, health, and productivity. These additives must also undergo a rigorous pre-approval process.

* Drug Residues: The FDA has regulations to control drug residues in animal products (meat, milk, eggs) to ensure the safety of the food supply.  They establish tolerance levels for drug residues that are allowed in these products to minimize any potential health risks to humans consuming the food.

* Resources: The CVM provides various resources for the public, veterinarians, and drug manufacturers such as the "Green Book" (officially known as "Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) for Veterinary Drugs").  This database contains information on approved veterinary drugs.

In essence, "Animal Drugs @ FDA" encompasses the entire regulatory framework and activities surrounding the approval, use, and monitoring of medications and feed additives used in animals in the United States, ensuring both the health of animals and the safety of the human food supply.
