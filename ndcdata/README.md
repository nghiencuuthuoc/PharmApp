# National Drug Code (NDC) Data
National Drug Code (NDC), a unique 10-digit, three-segment number assigned to each medication package in the United States.  The NDC is used to identify the labeler (manufacturer or distributor), product (drug and dosage form), and trade package size.  It's not an identification number for the specific drug itself but rather for a specific commercial package of a drug.

## Here's a breakdown of the NDC structure:

Labeler Code (first 5 digits): Identifies the manufacturer or distributor of the drug.
Product Code (next 4 digits): Identifies the specific drug, its strength, and dosage form.
Package Code (last 1 digit): Identifies the specific package size.

## Uses of the NDC:

Tracking and Tracing:  Facilitates tracking medications through the supply chain, from manufacturing to dispensing.
Inventory Management:  Used for managing inventory in pharmacies, hospitals, and wholesalers.
Data Collection:  Allows for collection of data on medication sales and usage.
Fraud Prevention: Helps detect and prevent counterfeit medications.
Patient Safety:  Assists in verifying the authenticity of medication.


## Where to find the NDC:

The NDC is typically found on the medication label.  It's usually a 10-digit number, often shown in a specific format (e.g., 00000-0000-00).

## Limitations:

The NDC does not uniquely identify a specific drug.  Different manufacturers can have different NDCs for the same drug if they sell it in different packages.
The NDC is primarily used in the United States; other countries use different drug identification systems.


In summary, the NDC is a vital identifier for tracking and managing medications in the U.S., but it's crucial to recognize that it identifies a specific package of a drug rather than the drug substance itself.
